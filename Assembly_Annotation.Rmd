#Analysis of *Flavobacteriaceae* whole genomes sequencing data:

Illumina MiSeq an HiSeq sequencing data of Flavobacteriaceae genomes were deposited at the the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). Study accession number........

The complete workflow:

    1. Trimming and Adapter removal of raw reads
    2. Genome Assembly and quality control
    3. Genome annotation
